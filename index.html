This beautiful dua calls upon Maliki Yawmid-Deen (The Master of the Day of Judgment) — asking Allah ﷻ to grant us resurrection in the company of the most honored souls:
The Anbiya (Prophets), the Awliya (His beloved friends), the Siddiqeen (truthful ones), the Shuhada (martyrs), and the Saliheen (righteous).
Because on that Day, company will define destiny…

“Whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His grace: the Prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. What an excellent company they are!” — Qur’an (Surah An-Nisa 4:69)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Maliki Yawmid-Deen (O Master of the Day of Judgment), on the Day of Resurrection, raise us in the company of the Anbiya (Prophets), Awliya (Your close friends), Sidiqeen (the truthful), Shuhada (the martyrs), and Saliheen (the righteous).*

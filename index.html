    const message = `*Will you be raised with the righteous?*

Pause for a moment, turn your heart sincerely toward Allah, and read this short duʿāʾ for resurrection in noble company. Then forward it to 5 people to earn ongoing reward and duʿā.

*Niyyah*:

I intend this recitation of this du'a for myself, the compilers, the sharers, and the recipients.

*The Duʿāʾ*:

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Maliki Yawmid-Deen (O Master of the Day of Judgment), on the Day of Resurrection, raise us in the company of the Anbiya (Prophets), Awliya (Your close friends), Sidiqeen (the truthful), Shuhada (the martyrs), and Saliheen (the righteous).

Because of the niyyah, when others recite this after you share it, you are included in their duʿāʾ. They will be praying for you to be raised in the company of the righteous too.

This is 1 of 23 supplications from *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings*.

*Take a few seconds now and forward this to at least 5 people* — so the reward of spreading goodness increases for you, and duʿāʾs continue to be made for you with every sincere recitation.

This beautiful dua calls upon Maliki Yawmid-Deen (The Master of the Day of Judgment) — asking Allah ﷻ to grant us resurrection in the company of the most honored souls: The *Anbiya (Prophets)*, the *Awliya (His beloved friends)*, the *Siddiqeen (truthful ones)*, the *Shuhada (martyrs)*, and the *Saliheen (righteous)*.

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Maliki Yawmid-Deen (O Master of the Day of Judgment), on the Day of Resurrection, raise us in the company of the Anbiya (Prophets), Awliya (Your close friends), Sidiqeen (the truthful), Shuhada (the martyrs), and Saliheen (the righteous).

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

For detailed information on this and the full *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* in both (English + Arabic) visit: https://www.duasharing.com/

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
